            <p class = "educationbody1">I am currently a second year Computer Science Student at University of Texas at Dallas. I formerly went to Collin County Community College to proceed with my core classes. During my time at Collin County Community College, I was given the gift of time to be able to explore different fields, originally including Information Technology and Cybersecurity. After spending sometime trying to learn the technologies I would expect, I dipped my toes into programming, and fell in love with it, furthering my education with Python, exploring different libraries, to find out what I liked, and moved forward from there. </p>
              
              <p class = "educationbody2">I have learned a majority of my coding knowledge base from experimenting with trying out projects(Primarily including simple Java projects for simple interactions, automated mad libs, by scraping the interest for random, verbs, nouns and adjectives, for a random mad lib each time it is ran. ), and taking online courses to teach myself further. This includes the Harvard Introductory Courseware, Codecademy(Python 3 Course, as well as associated Pandas, and Statistics within Python, and the Full Stack Web Development Course), and FreeCodeCamp. </p>
