Specfics on Features:
  - Shadow on button, when hovering, since the text will be that cream color, will use a muted blue as the high light color. 
  - Seperate pages to demonstrate that I know how to use different files for a single webpage. 


Further elaboration: 


When it comes to the actual content here is what is going to be used(This will be organized by page, starting with home page, top to bottom)

Heading:
(Heading section - Size class H1) 
coltonparham.tech(all lowercase)

(Heading section - Nav Tag Size class H2)
Navigation: Home - About - Projects - Education - Contact Me

[From this point we will have a grid which will include the picture, heading, body text, ongoing projects, and skills]
*GRID START*

(Image I used for groupme - resolution should be around 30% width, and will scale as needed. Will be on the left of the webpage about 10-15% padding from the beginning of the page) 
Picture Used:

(The heading will be for the paragraph sized at H3 and will be directly next to the the picture, and be at the same peak height of the top of the picture.)
Information Block Heading: Some information about me! 

(This will be a <p> tag, or a paragraph, most likely 1.2-1.5 em. We will be scaling this with a media query as expected. )
Information Block: Hello! My name is Colton Parham, I am currently a second year Computer Science major at UTD(Universersity of Texas at Dallas) with a primary focus in Web Development/Full Stack. I currently have 2 ongoing projects primarily focusing in education, using HTML, CSS, JS and SQL. The languages I primarily use are Javascript(Node and React Native), HTML5, CSS and SQl. 

(This will be under the Information block and be a <p> tag, with 1.2-1.5em )
Ongoing projects: Coding Education project, a website/application with the intent of being able to bring up simple explanations of general topics such as data types, and data structures. Another project I am currently working on is a Expiration code logger/reminder to aid in keeping track of when food expires. 

(This will be directly under the ongoing projects to display my knowledge and extent of my understanding. This will be a <ul> <li> situation, where it will display the languages in a 1.1em size.)
Tech Stack and Langauges: 
  - JavaScript
  - NodeJS
  - ReactNative
  - HTML 
  - CSS
  - Python 3(Including frameworks: MatPlotLib, NumPy, Pandas)
  - Java 11
  - SQl(Postgre SQL)
  - IBM Cognos


*GRID END*

Thats it for the home page.

(The about page will consist of two parts the heading, and the actual information present.)
About page: 

(The about heading will use the H2 and be centered in the middle of the screen)
About Heading: About

(The about body will be a <p> tag, the font will be a 1.5em font size)
About Body: My name is Colton Parham. I am currently a second year college student, studying Computer Science at University of Texas at Dallas. My current primary focus is Web Development, to be more specific Full Stack. I have been working with computerss, and computer archictecture since 2013. I first learned Python 2 in 2014, and continued my pursuits in programming in 2017, with an initial introduction to CSS and HTML, and moved forward from there. I've worked with many small local businesses and establishents on creating websites over the years that utilize submission forms, interactive features, point of sale, and responsive web design. 

(Second Paragraph <p> 1.5em directly under the first paragraph.)
About Body 2: For employment, I have worked on contract for websites since 2017, and have created, designed and published 7 websites since then. I am currently employed by a fortunte 500 Banking Software Company, and my current position is providing software support for banks, and credit unions. 

(This page will consist of the 2 ongoing projects I am working on, the OCR application for expiration code, and education website for general index of applications.)
Project Page:

(This will use an H2 and be centered in the middle of the screen.)
Project Heading: Ongoing Projects.

(This will be a <p> tag, with 1.5 em for the font size, this will be directly under heading.)
Project Body 1: OCR for Expiration Dates, is an application I am personally developing using Javascript, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS accordingly. Primarily utilizing the Tesseract Framework for Javascript to create the ability to scan an expiration code, and transcribe the information into strings, convert it into to a date format. After converting to the date value, into something that the application can register, and provide reminders to the user that the food, or consumable objects. 

(This will be a <p> tag, with 1.5 em for the font size, this will be directly under body 1.)
Project Body 2: Code Clarity, an education oriented website for simple explanations on the general topics of code. It is an application/website that serves the purpose of simplifying concepts for beginning programmers. I am personally developing this using HTML, CSS, ReactNative, and SQL. 

(This page will consist of one simple body paragraph entailing the details of my education.)
Education Page: 

(This will use an H2 heading and be centered in the middle of the screen)
Education Heading: Education

(This will be a <p> tag, with 1.5em for the font size, and will be directly under the heading.)
Education Body 1: I am currently a second year Computer Science Student at University of Texas at Dallas. I formerly went to Collin County Community College to proceed with my core classes. During my time at Collin County Community College, I was given the gift of time to be able to explore different fields, originally including Information Technology and Cybersecurity. After spending sometime trying to learn the technologies I would expect, I dipped my toes into programming, and fell in love with it, furthering my education with Python, exploring different libraries, to find out what I liked, and moved forward from there. 

(This will be a <p> tag, with 1.5em for the font size, and will be directly under the heading.)
Education Body 2: I have learned a majority of my coding knowledge base from experimenting with trying out projects, and taking online courses to teach myself further. This includes the Harvard Introductory Courseware, Codecademy, and FreeCodeCamp. 

(This page will consist of a header and the actual submission form. Refer to this for more information: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp)
Contact Me Page:

(This will use an H2 heading and be centered in the middle of the screen)
Contact Me Header: Contact Me

(This will be a submission form, that consist of a HTML and CSS, and will be stored to the server, and be sent directly to me.)
Contact Me Submission Form: 
  (This will be an H3 size - Pose as the heading)
  *Contact Me*
    (This will be an H4 size - This will be the email address that will be identified as the sender.)
      *Your Email*

            (This will be a <textarea> with a height of 200px.)
              *Messsage*

(Going to be creating a wireframe using JustInMind)
WireFrame: Will be sectioned off like any other 

Touching back onto design: 
What we will be needing to do is apply apply everything seperately and accordingly, and try to match everything as much as possible to be the same positioning to be universally coherent. 

As well the styles.css file will be attached to all the HTML files due to the simplifications and making things work in unison, and allocate less resources to make the page run faster.

As well - Don't forget to copy some of the information from the index page for the skelton to aide in making some things more universal. And also don't forget to link the files to each nav bar link.

Also do not forget the footer for each page - consistancy is key, and for those elements, we will have those in the default setting. 

Since the home page is pretty much done, we need to finish adding the information to the rest of the pages, and we will modify all of this within the css file to make sure that everything looks great. 

Follow up with this information to create the links for the webpage - maybe touch back to the codecademy example: https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/myfirstsite/basiclinks.html
