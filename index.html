            <h2>Some information about me!</h2>
              <p>My name is Colton Parham. I am currently a second year college student, studying Computer Science at University of Texas at Dallas. My current primary focus is Web Development, to be more specific Full Stack. I have been working with computers, and computer architecture since 2013. I first learned Python 2 in 2014, and continued my pursuits in programming in 2017, with an initial introduction to CSS and HTML, and moved forward from there. I've worked with many small local businesses and establishents on creating websites over the years that utilize submission forms, interactive features, point of sale, and responsive web design.</p>

            <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
              <p>OCR for Expiration Dates, is an application I am personally developing using Javascript, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS accordingly. Primarily utilizing the Tesseract Framework for Javascript to create the ability to scan an expiration code, and transcribe the information into strings, convert it into to a date format. After converting to the date value, into something that the application can register, and provide reminders to the user that the food, or consumable objects. The other project I am working on is Code Clarity, an education oriented website for simple explanations on the general topics of code. It is an application/website that serves the purpose of simplifying concepts for beginning programmers. I am personally developing this using HTML, CSS, ReactNative, and SQL.</p>

<!--At this very moment, this first page is done, and I have better idea where to go from here. Will be making a grid for the projects page next, and possible adjust the page to see if I can seperate the heading/nav bar from everything. as well potentially add another image to see if that will suffice, and appease the CSS/HTML gods. -->
