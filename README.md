# Colton-Parham-Portfolio-Website
Portfolio Website for myself.


This website is created for me (Colton Parham) as a portfolio to displaey my current endeavors, as a student, and aspiring Full Stack engineer.

This website was created with the Django HTML5, the most recent version of CSS. 

Original intentions of the websites were held to use vanilla JavaScript for some of the design elements, but found in this case CSS works more than okay. 

Originally there were 6 total pages, but as the continued production of the website, and many, many revisions to the whole site, it was found that it would be more efficent and yield better results to condense the information as related as needed in the correct places.

This website was created, and designed by Colton Parham(Author of this repository)

All design logs and specifications are logged within the info.md file. THis includes sources, planning, images, and further explanation and elaboration on specific issues.
